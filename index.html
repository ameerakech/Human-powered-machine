        <h2>RULE BOOK</h2>
        <P>The goal of the Trait Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to get three tokens in a row on the game board
            <br>
            that is either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally by making babies with the special trait using pairs
            of gene cards.

                Players: 2 players

                Choose traits: Each player is given one trait they need to collect, for example:<br>
                Player 1: Blue Eyes (recessive trait)<br>
                Player 2: Curly hair (dominant trait)<br>

                Cards: Shuffle all the trait gene cards. Each card shows a trait with a symbol:<br>

                Star shape = Dominant gene<br>
                Moon shape = Recessive gene<br>

                Deal Cards:Give each player four cards to start.<br>

                Tokens: Each player gets a token with a unique symbol design to mark their spots on the board.<br>

                Game board: Use a Tic-Tac-Toe grid with 9 empty squares.<br>

            <h2>How to play</h2>
            On your turn, pick two cards from your hand. These cards represent the parent genes for one trait.<br>

            Check the baby’s trait:<br>
            If both cards together give the baby of your chosen special trait, place one of your tokens on an empty
            square
            on the board.<br>

            If the baby does not have your special trait, you do not place a token this turn.<br>

            Draw cards: After your turn, draw cards from the stacks of cards so you have 4 cards in your hand again.<br>

            The other player then takes their turn following the same steps.<br>
        </div>

        <div class="traits">
            <h2>Determination of baby's traits</h2>
            Dominant trait(represented by star shape): Only one dominant gene needed to show the trait.<br>
            Recessive trait(represented by moon shape): Two recessive genes needed to show the trait.<br>
            Example:<br>
            If you want “Curly hair”(dominant ), then if either of your 2 cards is dominant for hair then the baby has
            curly
            hair.<br>
            If you want “Blue eyes”(recessive), then both cards must be recessive for eye color to have blue eyes.<br>
        </div>

        <div class="winning">
            <h2>Winning-the-game</h2>
            The first player to place three tokens in a row on the board, either across, down, or diagonally, wins the
            game.<br>
            If all 9 squares are filled and no one has 3 in a row, the game is a draw.<br>

        </div>
    </div>
<div class="genes">
    <p>
    <h2>Difference Between Dominant and Recessive Genes</h2><br>
    Dominant Gene
    A gene that shows its trait if there is only one copy. It “covers up” the other gene if it’s different. It’s like a
    bossy gene that decides what the baby looks like.
    </p>

    <p>Recessive Gene
        A gene that only shows its trait if both copies are the same recessive gene. If there is a dominant gene, the
        recessive one hides and doesn’t show. It’s like a quiet gene that needs a twin to be seen.
    </p>

    <p>Example:
        If you have one dominant gene for brown eyes and one recessive gene for blue eyes, the baby will have brown eyes
        because the dominant gene wins.
        To have blue eyes, the baby must have two recessive blue eye genes.
